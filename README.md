# SourceFilesAndMethods
Python script for retrieving source files and methods.

So far it only runs in the console and all the information is output into it. I plan to have it writing to a file of some sort this week. 

The JSON files were generated with |mach test testing/mochitest|.

The script should be run in a folder containing JSON files and SimpleTest.js from the directory:
mozilla-central/obj-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/_tests/testing/mochitest/mochijar/chrome/mochikit/content/tests/SimpleTest/SimpleTest.js

You could also modify the couple of statements and change the directory to look through.

Any suggestions for improvements are greatly appreciated!
